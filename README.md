# DiceRoll
Pick your die and give it a roll!

Allows a user to pick a type of die to roll, how many times they want to roll it, and if they want to add any modifiers to the sum. 
Then executes the rolls, creating a list of each roll done, and then sums them all up, then adds the modifier. 
Finally, asks the user if they want to roll again, and if so, the program loops to the beginning, allowing for another roll.
This game could be used for games like Dungeons & Dragons and Magic the Gathering, which rely heavily on dice rolls for game functions.
